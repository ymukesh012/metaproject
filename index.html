            <p>Little Lemon Restaurant is the new Restaurant in town with mouth watering dishes including Indian, Chinese, Tandoori, Mexican, Carrebian and much more.
            This Restaurant Was Established in the year 2020 at Birgunj City, Nepal. Now spreading our flavours worldwide !
            With a great reputation in Japan, We would like to achieve the same everywhere we establish our branch.
        We realize numerous individuals love Indian sustenance, yet a large number of them loathe or are unconscious of the regularly unfortunate fixings that make run-of-the-mill Indian nourishment taste so great.
            Little Lemon has developed to incorporate four superb takeout areas in Toronto with additional to come sooner rather than later. Our group takes pride in the way that we can furnish our new and faithful clients with extraordinary tasting Indian-roused
                nourishment that is not normal for that at some other Indian eatery you visit.
            We perceive that a few people are as yet searching for the run-of-the-mill Indian nourishment, and that is fine with us. Our disclaimer is that on the off chance that you're anticipating overwhelming, slick, undesirable Indian nourishment,
                Little Lemons isn't the place for you. </p>
